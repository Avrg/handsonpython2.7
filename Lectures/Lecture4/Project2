Hi, I hope you are excited! Just remember not to run unknown/confusing code if you feel like testing other submissions ;)

Project 2: Let's make a character!
Who does not like creating characters? I hope no one. Our task is very exciting as we will make a character generator. You should come up
with a list which has all character data. Then ask user to enter it by asking different questions. If you feel like making something
more complex you can add traits and give special actions to them for example if trait: print 'You are bald warrior with a scar on your back'
If this is not enough you can add it to the project one so you will have choose your own adventure with customatization!

Same deal for submitting just name it p2_nameoftheproject and submit it to coolstuff1. If this is your 2nd update to your previous
submission just update the original file and ask for pull into master.
If stuck feel free to contact me to ask for help :)
