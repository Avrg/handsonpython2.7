Congrats on getting this far. Now its time to put everything you learned to practice.
Now its time to create something great! Try to come up with some awesome idea and implement it.
I will suggest a few down below.

When coming up with an idea make sure its not too broad and that you will be able to reach it in 
reasonable time. Break up the idea into parts and consider implementing them one at a time.
Don't give up! Just dont!

Suggestions:
Create a barebones rpg/roguelike (basically create the engine and implement one type of item/block only
you should be able to play the game fully but it will just lack variety. Once finished you can add more content)

Create a calculator. Simple and easy. Now go and make something bigger!

Create a database of your favourite books/cartoons/movies with your personal reviews. Make the program self sufficient meaning that you
can edit, delete and make new files from it.

Create a time scheduler. Use time and timedate libraries to get time and make the program promt you an earlier made plan each day.

Come up with the next big thing. Or try to do that!
