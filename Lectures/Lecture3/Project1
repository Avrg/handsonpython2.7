Hello guys! Welcome to github. It's a very popular code repository (I use gitlab for my personal stuff as it has public and private
repositories). As this is a free course it would be nice if you would make a small contribution to the world by sharing your awesome
projects. Everything in this particular repository is under general public license version 3 which basically states that if you are ever
to use code from here in your own project keep it open source and free (interpret free as gpl does, another reason to go read it up).
Basically it is a place where you can store your code. Pyhton is 
awesome as anyone can download the code and run it if they have python with no need to compile it. Few rules thoug. Before running
someone's elses code READ IT.

Now some housekeeping. I will add to this all major programs which we will make.

Project One:
Now you know about usr input printing, storing variables and most importantly how to make if statements.
Your task is to spend at least an hour making a choose your own adventure game. To simplify your task promt the user with the choices
and ask them to type only a number. If you want to make it even more awesome add some uniquiness to your story. One simple thing is you
can interact with user and ask them for the name of the hero and use it storytelling! Your only limit is imagination!
If you would like to share this with the world. Remember if you are stuck and need help msg me. If you want to share this awesome project
with me give me a link. Or make a fork of this project and add it to the Cool stuff P1 folder name it p1_nameoftheproject 
and make a pull request! After that I am likely to accept it to the master branch so everyone can check your cool program out!

AGAIN if you are to run a file by anoter user check it with antivirus (virus total is a great free website) and read the code. It is 
also going to help you grow as programmer!
